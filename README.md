# Big Data HW2: Hadoop/Pig Solution (Grade 85)

This repository contains the solution for the second submission assignment in the Big Data course (Shenkar College, IE&M), which focuses on distributed data processing using the **Hadoop/Pig** framework (Pig Latin language).

The project successfully implemented core Big Data engineering skills, including complex aggregation and text processing on fragmented datasets, achieving a grade of **85**.

## 🎯 Key Skills Demonstrated

* **Hadoop/Pig Latin Mastery:** Utilizing the Pig Latin language for efficient data manipulation and analysis in a distributed environment (MapReduce abstraction).
* **Distributed Aggregation:** Implementing complex averaging, ordering, and filtering logic across multiple input files simultaneously.
* **Advanced Text Processing:** Applying Pig functions (SIZE, LOWER, CONCAT, REPLACE) for data cleaning and extraction on unstructured text data.
* **Handling Case Sensitivity (Text Functions):** Demonstrating the ability to handle data inconsistencies and perform case-insensitive operations using functions like `LOWER()`, a critical task in Big Data processing.
* **Multi-File Data Handling:** Loading and combining data from fragmented sources, typical of an HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) environment.

## Repository Content - Hadoop/Pig Files

| File Name | Description | Role in Assignment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`DATA.txt`, `DATA1.txt`... `DATA4.txt`** | **Hadoop/Pig Scripts (Code):** These files contain the working scripts written in Pig Latin. They define the logic for data loading, aggregation, ordering, and text manipulation. | **Solution Code** |
| **`df.txt`... `df4.txt`** | **Output Files (Results):** Segmented output files showing the results of the Pig scripts, including calculated averages and final text processing results, as required by the assignment. | **Final Output** |
| **`data000.txt`, `data002.txt`** | **Input Data:** Sample raw input files used for the distributed processing. | **Input Data** |
| **`docs/Assignment_Instructions_2.pdf`** | Original assignment instructions. | **Documentation** |
