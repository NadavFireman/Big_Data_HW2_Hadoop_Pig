# Big Data HW2: Hadoop/Pig Distributed Processing Solution (Grade 85)

This repository contains the solution for the second submission assignment in the Big Data course (Shenkar College, IE&M). The project showcases the ability to process massive, distributed datasets using the **Hadoop/Pig** framework.

The work successfully implemented core Big Data engineering skills, including aggregation, filtering, and advanced text manipulation on fragmented datasets, resulting in a grade of **85**.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

* **Hadoop/Pig Expertise:** Applying the Pig Latin language to efficiently manipulate and analyze large volumes of data in a distributed environment (MapReduce abstraction).
* **Distributed Calculations:** Performing complex aggregation (averaging, summing) and sorting logic across multiple input files simultaneously.
* **Advanced Text Handling:** Using Pig functions (SIZE, LOWER, CONCAT, REPLACE) to clean, extract, and standardize unstructured text data.
* **Handling Data Quality:** Demonstrating the ability to fix data issues like inconsistent capitalization and perform reliable data comparisons.
* **Multi-File Data Management:** Managing and combining data loaded from multiple source files, simulating a real-world HDFS environment.

## Repository Content - Hadoop/Pig Files

| File Name | Description | Role in Assignment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DATA.txt, DATA1.txt... DATA4.txt** | **Pig Scripts (Code):** These files contain the working code written in Pig Latin. They define the logic for data loading, calculating averages, sorting, and text manipulation. | Solution Code |
| **df.txt... df4.txt** | **Output Files (Results):** Segmented text files showing the final results of the Pig scripts, including calculated averages and text processing outputs. | Final Output |
| **data000.txt, data002.txt** | **Input Data:** Sample raw input files used for the distributed processing. | Input Data |
| **EX2.pdf** | Original assignment instructions. | Documentation |
